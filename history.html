			The SV650 was first released in North America in 1999 and was considered a budget entry bike taking
			advantage of the emerging naked bike market. For the first run of production it only came in its naked version, 
			and in two colors: red and blue. Due to the United States' love for sporty, cool looking things they released the 
			Canadian-only version  to the U.S. which included half-fairings, clip-on handlebars and a more
			leaned forward riding position. The first four years of the bike's life featured a carbureted<sup>[<a href="dictionary.html#Carburetion">3</a>]</sup> 
			fuel delivery system, and curvy late 90s/early 00s body design.

			Coming into 2003 a totally redesigned SV650 was introduced. The SV650 got a new boxy looking aluminum 
			frame, and updated fairing and body design. The engine delivered a boost in output (+9 hp) versus earlier models as 
			the carburetors were finally replaced with electronic fuel injection. New additions were an LCD instrument panel, 
			center positioned analog tachometer, a fuel reserve indicator, new swingarm<sup>[<a href="dictionary.html#Swingarm">4</a>]</sup> 
			with revised rear brake caliper mounting, and a new exhaust just to name a few. These aggressive aesthetics and geometry stylings would stay with the bike until 
			it stopped production in 2009. In 2004 Suzuki lowered the subframe a total of 40 mm (~1.6 in), and made the saddle more
			narrow to accomadate shorter riders need to flat-foot<sup>[<a href="dictionary.html#Flat-foot">5</a>]</sup>. New colors were 
			a metallic orange (see left), a throwback light blue from the original '00-'02 models, and silver.

			The year 2005 introduced the rising popularity of black powder-coated motorcycle frames and Suzuki followed suit with the SV. This minor
			change was in addition to decreasing the engine radiator size from 440 mm to 410 mm (17 in to 16 in). There was also a small windscreen added
			to the naked models to protect the gauge cluster. New colors were a sort of aquamarine blue, and a pale blue.

			New for 2007 was an added system of twin spark plugs within the engine for more efficient fuel consumption. This was also the first year the option of factory 
			ABS was available. 2008 brought forth SV650SF models with full fairings all the way down the sides of the bike. To the right, note the "ABS"
			stamp on the front right mudguard.

			Unfortunately in 2009 the SV650 was discontinued and superseded by the "SFV650 Gladius." Though it was a fine bike, with its high MSRP of $7,999,
			the bottom falling out of the motorcycle market because of the '08 recession, and its general ugly look, the Gladius never caught traction the way
			the SV650 did.
			Though in November 2015 Suzuki 
			<a href="future.html">announced</a> that the SV650 would be making a return in 2016 as a 2017-model year product.

			The 2017 model released in 2016, SV650/A has returned to the more conventional styling of the pre-Gladius naked version. Suzuki claims the wet weight 
			for the non-ABS model is 195 kg (430 lbs), and 197 kg (434 lbs) for the ABS model. Its engine develops an additional four horsepower and features a 
			low-speed stalling prevention system ("low RPM assist") to make the bike more suited to beginners and easier to ride in stop/go traffic. It has a new slim 
			steel frame. Seat height is 785mm (30.9"). Fuel tank capacity is 13.8 litres, or 15.5 litres in the US market. It has twin front disc brakes and new 39mm 
			slimmer and lighter throttle bodies.
