		To my surprise, a new SV650 was announced this past November. It's been nearly 7 years since the SV650 was 
		put on the shelf in favor of the SFV650. According to Suzuki the SV650 is going "back to its origin." The new SV
		is based off the old Gladius with more than 60 new parts, and greater than 140 single components redesigned. A claim of 75 hp was made
		(up from the SFV's 71 and the previous SV's 73.4), while its curb weight drops about 17 pounds for the ABS model.</p>
		<p>Updates include a new low-rpm assist mode, which activates a higher idle speed at low engine revs to assist with
		inner city commuting like leaving a stop and running in stop-and-go traffic. Also included is an updated ignition
		button that allows a rider to only have to momentarily push it to start the bike. With the body also being more
		narrow and lighter than previous iterations, the seat height has also been lowered.
		<br/>

		Sales blurb from Suzuki's official webpage for the new SV:
		<div class="bdr" style="text-align:center;padding:10px;margin:30px;">
		<i>"For 2017, Suzuki introduces a new version of an iconic motorcycle that embodies the sporty personality that only 
		a lively, mid-sized V-twin roadster can deliver. The new SV650 ABS has a polished powerplant that provides 
		increased performance with low emissions and outstanding fuel economy, mated to refined trim and lightweight 
		chassis that delivers a sporty, exciting ride. Like its predecessors, the 2017 SV650 promises to have the sparkling 
		performance, style and value that a broad range of riders will enjoy."</i>

		Needless to say, I am a bit excited. I'm not going head over heels for this bike as I dislike modern takes on classic
		looks in any sort of design, but I am glad that the true SV650 is back. I'm still going to search for a pre-2009 model though.
