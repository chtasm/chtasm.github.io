			<a id="V-Twin">V-Twin</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">As opposed to parallel Straight-Twin, or Inline-4 engines in many other modern motorcycles, 
		V-Twins have their two cylinders in a "V" position similar to V6s or V8s in typical 4-wheeled automobile engine configurations. A classic 
		motorcycle engine look (think Harley-Davidson or similar cruiser models). [<a href="../images/vtwin.jpg">Pic</a>]</p>

			<a id="ABS">ABS</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">Anti-lock Braking System or "ABS" allows brakes on automobiles to pulse on and off (as opposed to locking up) under heavy braking.
		This is a relatively new technology for motorcycles that will save newer and experienced riders alike in emergency braking situations as locking up
		either wheel during distress can prove disastrous to rider balance and safety.</p>
		<h3 class="hdr">
			<a id="Carburetion">Carburetion</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">Carburetors blend air and fuel for internal combustion engines. Old technology as far as fuel delivery systems go, 
		carburetors were the mainstay for motorcycle manufacters even as the automotive industry moved away from them since attaching modern 
		fuel injection systems to smaller motors (like for motorcycles) was not cost effective.

			<a id="Swingarm">Swingarm</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">The main component of the rear suspension of most modern motorcycles and ATVs. It is used to hold the rear axle firmly, 
		while pivoting vertically, to allow the suspension to absorb bumps in the road. [<a href="../images/swingarm.jpg">Pic</a>]

		Being able to flat-foot a bike means having the ability to place both feet flat on the ground while keeping the bike
		upright when stopped. This is some times a concern for shorter riders as they'd need to lean the bike to one side when stopped if the ride
		height is too high for them. See the photos to the right of a rider who is around 5'11" versus another who is about 5'6".

			<a id="Wet%20Weight">Wet Weight/Dry Weight</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">"Wet weight" is the weight of a motorcycle measured when all fluids and equipment (engine oil, gasoline, coolant, brake fluid, blinker fluid, battery) have been
		added/installed to their respective locations. The weight of a motorcycle affects its handling substantially, and therefore this piece of measurement is 
		used to gauge performance. "Dry weight" is the opposite.

			<a id="Belly$20Pan">Belly Pan</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="def">Belly pans or "chin spoilers" are pieces of fairing that attach to the underside of a motorcycle for looks and/or practicality. If you are to race your bike on a track 
		you are required to have one as they help contain any fluid leakage from the engine area dripping off your bike and onto the track. Located underneath engine in black: [<a href="../images/belly_pan.jpg">Pic</a>]
